 * \brief Posadis abstract resolver class
 *
 * This is the abstract base class for the Posadis resolver functionality. The
 * pos_resolver class offers functions for both UDP and TCP resolving. For UDP
 * resolving, use the high-level query() functions. sendmessage() and
 * waitanswer() are low-level functions that applications would not normally
 * want to call. The same goes for TCP: tcpconnect() tcpdisconnect() and
 * tcpquery() are the functions it's all about.
 *
 * You can modify some parameters by setting member functions of the class, and
 * by specifying custom flags for the query functions.
 *
 * Like we mentioned, this is an abstract class that should _not_ be used
 * directly. For client applications, use the pos_cliresolver class, and for
 * server applications, use pos_srvresolver.
 *
 * Note that pos_resolver actually _does_ contain a complete TCP
 * implementation, so, theoretically it could be instantiated directly for use
 * as a TCP resolver. This is however not encouraged.

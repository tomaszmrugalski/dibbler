 * \brief bitmask manipulation
 *
 * This source file provides some macros to easily handle bit masks, which
 * are basically just character arrays. These macros do not handle the creation
 * of bitmasks, so you'll need to do that yourself. To create a bitmask for
 * x bits, allocate a character array of (x + 7) / 8 bytes. And be sure to
 * memset() it to reset all bits in one! Also note the first bitmap index is
 * zero and the last one is x - 1.

 * \brief set a bit in the bitmask
 *
 * Sets the bit value for the given bit in the bitmask.
 * \param a The bitmask, a character array
 * \param b Bit index in the bitmask

 * \brief checks whether a bit is set

 * is set, the function returns nonzero. Note that it _might_ return 1, but
 * that it usually doesn't so don't depend on that!

 * \param b Bit index in the bitmask

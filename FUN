I've found this in IfaceMgr.h (just generated from Rational Rose):

  int addAddr(void char *iface, void char * addr);
  int delAddr(void int iface, void char *addr);
  int delAddr(void char *iface, void char *addr);

 from ../include/ClntIfaceMgr.h:4,
 from Msg.h:4,
 from Msg.cpp:2:
 /usr/include/stdint.h:50: declaration does not declare anything

At compile time I got this: (dir: ClntParser: make parser)
cc1plus: register name not specified for ` /* decl error */ '
../include/Container.h:28: Internal compiler error:
../include/Container.h:28: Internal compiler error in `make_decl_rtl', at varasm.c:742

Abstract

   DHCPv6 protocol offers the capability of automatic allocation of
   reusable IPv6 addresses to all interested clients. Unfortunately,
   there is no way to specify additional parameters related to such
   addresses, like prefix length they belong to. Without such data,
   clients located on the same link can't communicate.

   This document defines methods for providing additional address
   parameters to the clients, so appropriate routing to link-local
   prefix can be configured. Mechanism for requesting and providing
   anycast and multicast addresses is also proposed.

Table of Contents

1. Introduction

   During normal DHCPv6 [RFC3315] operation, server assigns addresses
   to all interested clients. Unfortunately, clients located on the
   same link and receiving addresses from the same server are able to
   configure IPv6 addresses only. The information about prefix length
   is not available, so clients are not able to configure routing to
   local prefixes. Without such routing configured, clients are not
   able to exchange IPv6 datagrams.

   By using Address Parameters option, server is able to specify
   prefix length of the granted address, so besides of configuring the
   address itself, client is able to configure corresponding route as 
   well.
   
   It is also possible for server to assign addresses with types other
   than normal unicast. Server can grant multicast or anycast
   addresses.

2. Requirements

   To take advantage of Address Parameters mechanism, implementation
   of the DHCPv6 protocol, which supports Address Parameters Option is
   required.

3. Operation overview

   If client supports Address Parameters Option it SHOULD send 
   OPTION_ADDRPARAMS in the Option Request Option in SOLICIT, REQUEST,
   RENEW and REBIND messages.

   Server, upon receiving such message, if configured to support
   Address Parameters Option, SHOULD attach that option as a suboption
   to every granted address. Due to backward compatibility, server 
   MUST NOT attach Address Parametere Option, unless client asked for
   it explicely in ORO.

   All DHCPv6 mechanisms work as defined in RFC3315. When Address
   Parameters Option is used, every IAADDR option contains exactly
   one Address Parameters suboption.

3.1 Client operation

   If client is configured to use Address Parameters option, it MUST
   attach OPTION_ADDRPARAMS to Option Request Option list. Client CAN
   ask for ADDRPARAMS option in the SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW and REBIND
   messages only. Client MUST NOT use ADDRPARAMS option in the ORO in
   any other messages.

3.2 Server operation

   Server appends Address Parameters option to all IAADDR options sent
   to a client, which requested IA configuration and asked for Address
   Parameters option. Server, by default, MUST NOT attach this option,
   unless specificaly asked by the client.

4. Address parameters option

   The Address Parameters option is sent by a server to a client to
   provide additional informations about granted addresses. Address 
   Parameters Option can only be sent as a suboption of the IAADDR
   option. It can be sent by the server to define addtional address
   parameters. It can also be sent by the client in SOLICIT or REQUEST
   messages as a hint for the server.

   The format of the Preference option is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |       OPTION_ADDRPARAMS       |          option-len           |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  prefix-len   |   flags       |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      option-code   OPTION_ADDRPARAMS (TBD).

      option-len    2.

      prefix-len    Prefix length. Allowed values are: 0-128

      flags         Defines type of the address and additional
                    information. See following subsection for details.

4.1.  The Flags Field

   The format of the Flags field is:

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  MBZ    |M|A|P|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       MBZ - reserved field (must be zero)
       M   - is this multicast address? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
       A   - is this anycast address? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
       P   - should prefix information be ignored? (1 = ignore, 0 =
             prefix field contains valid information)

   [Values are choosen in that way, so during most use scenarios,
   flags field will remain set to 0.]

5. Compatibility issues
  
  Clients not supporting this option may be unable to parse IADDR
  option, which contains ADDRPARAMS option. Therefore server MUST
  NOT send ADDRPARAMS, unless explicitely asked to do so by the 
  client (by mentioning ADDRPARAMS in the Option Request Option).

6. Open issues

6.1 Address scope

 Would it be useful to add 4-bit field, which describes scope of the
 address (link, site or global)? Host scope MUST NOT be allowed.
 organisation scope is depreciated, so it SHOULD NOT be used.

6.2 Client hints

 It may be useful to allow client to send ADDRPARAMS in SOLICIT and
 REQUEST messages as a hint. Client could use this feature to ask for
 a specific type of the address. Server could honor or ignore this
 hint. Client should include ADDRPARAMS option in the IA_NA option.

7. Security Considerations


8. IANA Considerations

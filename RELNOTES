  Dibbler 0.8.0 release notes [2011-05-11]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is the stable 0.8.0 release of the Dibbler software.

 Dibbler project now officially is resumed, after my Ph. D. and related
 almost complete lack of time. Since last 0.8.0RC1 release, significant
 number of features were added, so the numbering may be misleading.
 However, I didn't want to skip 0.8.0. Notable features added in this
 version are:

 - Mac OS X support, thanks to Paul Schauer, who did the initial port 
   and then tested and debugged countless versions.
 - Several new DNS Update modes implemented: server may discard unknown
   names sent by client, sanitize them, assign other available name from
   configured pool, append configure domain or even generate name, based
   on assigned address.
 - Linux client now configures and updates addresses with proper prefered 
   and valid lifetimes.
 - Vendor specific options format improved, it is now easier to define
   sub-options there.
 - DS-Lite draft implementation updated to latest, approved version (-10)
 - Client may now send defined prefix hints in PD

 Many (around 20) bug fixes are fixed as well.
 
 There's also number of under the hood changes that hopefully
 will be invisible to end users. If something that worked previously
 now crashes miserably, let me know.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.

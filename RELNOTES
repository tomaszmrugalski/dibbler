  Dibbler 0.8.1RC1 release notes [2011-11-11]
 ---------------------------------------------------------

 This is the first release candidate for 0.8.1 release of the Dibbler software.

 This candidate release introduces number of useful additions, new features
 and the usual bug fixes. In particular, the highlights of this release
 are:

 - Support for routing configuration was added. Yes, you read that correctly.
   Recent draft draft-ietf-mif-dhcpv6-route-option defines provisioning mechanism
   that delivers routing information over DHCPv6. Although this implementation is 
   not entirely complete (there are certain limitations, see User's Guide), it is
   very usable.
 - Script support is rewritten. Client can call a script every time it receives a 
   message and pass all received options as environment variables. That is very
   convenient way to extend client with custom actions. This feature is going to
   be further expanded in upcoming releases.
 - Server is now able to run scripts, too. That is convenient if you need your 
   server to execute custom actions. One notable example is a routing reconfiguration
   after prefix was delegated to a client.
 - Added support for FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Mac OS X support is now also
   significantly improved. To achieve this level of portability, build system
   was completely rewritten and is now using automake and autoconf tools.
   You can now use ./configure script to enable or disable various parameters.
   Makefile modification is no longer necessary.
 - DNS Update can now be performed over UDP, TCP or both (try over UDP and if it fails,
   try TCP). Configurable timeout for DNS Updates added.
 - Significant update in prefix delegation support. Server will now remember previously
   assigned prefixes and will try to assign the same prefix to returning client.
 - Support for DS-Lite tunnels configuration added (RFC6334)
 - Rather large User's Guide documentation update
 - Fixed mis-aligned memory reads on ARMv5 architecture
 - Added support for unittests using googletests. Number of tests is small now, 
   but is expected to grow.
 - source code migrated to git.

 Many bug fixes are fixed as well.

 See CHANGELOG for a complete list of changes.

 I would like to thank Mateusz Ozga for his routing implementation and Harro Han
 for his ARMv5 patches.

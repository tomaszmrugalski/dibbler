  Internal/code TODO
 --------------------
- Remove ClntCfgGroup class
- Statistics: TransMgr->dump() should be implemented.
- Change Srv/ClntOptServer/ClientIdentifier to use TOptGeneric class.
- IfaceMgr.cpp:232 (remove #ifndef WIN32)

- Clnt requests for Address and options (receives both and lifetime option). It should send renew only if T1<lifetime
  and renew and inf-request if T1>lifetime.

- 20. RFC3315: If the relay agent has not been explicitly configured,
  it MUST use the All_DHCP_Servers multicast address as the default.

- setting up a domain: echo homenetwork > /etc/dnsdomainname
- Flex (gentoo: emerge /usr/portage/sys-devel/flex/flex-2.5.31-r1.ebuild)

- check server's behavior: there isn't any addrs left, and srv receives SOLICIT.
  Does PREFERENCE have normal value (e.g. not faulty 255, check
   tex/test09/10th packet)


  Rewrite
 ---------
1. client's answers are generated by answer(...) method, whereas server's answer's 
   are generated in the relayMsg method by differents constructors of the same message.
   Shouldn't it be better to make it homogeneous ? I don't have any preference :)
2. Server ADVERTISE evaluations. There should be some kind of ranking
   system, which checks that IAs were provided as well as TAs. And
   options too.
3. Suboptions parsing. It's done in lots of places, but should be done
   in one. e.g. TSrvOptIA_NA, TClntOptIA_NA, TClntOptTA, TSrvOptTA constructors.
4. {Server|Client}Identifier is added in numerous places in SrvOpt*.cpp. It should be added
   in TSrvMsg::appendRequestedOptions()
5. How many addrs can be assigned to the client? Implement counter in the
   TAddrClient class.

  BUGS
 ------
 See http://klub.com.pl/bugzilla/

- When client receives NO-ADDR AVAILABLE, it simultaneusly:
  - starts SOLICIT transaction
  - sends REQUEST to next server on backup list.
- test11: reply contains empty IA with 2 STATUS CODE options:
  - unspecfail (1) + description "no such IA"
  - ok (!!!)


  INFO
 ------
- kernel sources: 
   addrconf.c:  inet6_rtm_newaddr() :1579
   ipv6_add_addr
   ndisc.c ndisc_router_discovery

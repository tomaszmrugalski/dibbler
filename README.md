# Dibbler - a portable DHCPv6

Dibbler is an open source, portable implementation of DHCPv6 protocol. It offers
a server, a client, a relay and requestor. 


# Project status

The project is now concluded. There are no future updates expected. I have dedicated 15 years of my life
to this project. It's time for me to move on. If you're interested in high quality open source DHCPv6 implementation,
please take a look at [ISC Kea](https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea).

Please contact Tomek if you're interested in joining this project as maintainer or developer.

## Note

There may be infrequent commits. I may take a look at submitted PRs or do some
experiments I need for my own purposes. But don't interpret this as the project
being resumed. Unless a new developer steps in, Dibbler is a concluded project.
